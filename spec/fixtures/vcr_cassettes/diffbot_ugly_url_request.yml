        News","text":"The gunman reportedly never said a word while shooting 71 people,
        killing 12, in a soldout show for \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" NBC News'' Miguel
        Almaguer reports.\nBy M. Alex Johnson and Pete Williams, NBC News\nUpdated
        at 10:14 p.m. ET: A graduate student''s attack in a sold-out theater near
        Denver showing the new Batman movie, in which 12 people were killed early
        Friday, was the culmination of two months of meticulous planning that included
        a potentially deadly booby trap left in the suspect''s home for investigators,
        authorities said.\nFifty-eight other people were injured, many of them seriously,
        in the shootings shortly after midnight at the Century 16 Movie Theaters complex
        in Aurora, Colo. Earlier reports had said 59 people were injured, but police
        revised that number at a news conference Friday night. All but a small handful
        of the injured had been shot, Police Chief Dan Oates said.\nThirty people
        remained in area hospitals Friday night, 11 of them in critical condition,
        after a carefully orchestrated attack in which the suspect, identified as
        James Eagan Holmes, 24, bought all of his weapons and ammunition legally beginning
        in May.\nLate Friday, the family of Alex Sullivan, 27, said in a statement
        that he was among the dead, the Denver Post and The Associated Press reported.
        Heart-wrenching photographs taken earlier Friday showed Sullivan''s father,
        Tom, grieving and pleading for information about his son.\nFederal and local
        enforcement officials said Holmes was sheathed in a helmet, a gas mask, a
        tactical bulletproof vest, throat and groin protectors and tactical gloves.
        All of the gear was black.\nHolmes was armed with two .40-caliber Glock handguns,
        a Remington 870 single-barrel pump shotgun, a Smith & Wesson AR-15 assault-style
        rifle and as many as 6,000 rounds of ammunition, Oates said.\nThe scene also
        appeared to have been specially targeted for maximum carnage \u2014 the local
        premiere of one of the most eagerly awaited movies of the year, \"The Dark
        Knight Rises,\" the third in the series of director Christopher Nolan''s Batman
        films.\nIn a statement, Nolan expressed \"profound sorrow at the senseless
        tragedy that has befallen the entire Aurora community.\"\nAurora, Colo., Police
        Chief Dan Oates says the suspect in the theater shootings bought his weapons
        and ammunition legally.\nAfter he was arrested outside the theater, Holmes
        told police that he was the Joker, a reference to one of the most prominent
        villains in the Batman canon, a law enforcement official told NBC News on
        condition of anonymity. (The official said the suspect had dyed his hair red
        or orange, which isn''t typically associated with the green-haired Joker character,
        who doesn''t appear in \"The Dark Knight Rises.\")\nAurora police said Holmes
        also booby-trapped his apartment with an elaborate network of wire-connected
        bottles containing an unknown liquid, presumably intended to go off when authorities
        arrived to canvass his home.\nHolmes told police about the trap before they
        arrived, however, and investigators hadn''t entered the apartment Friday night.
        They were analyzing gases and examining photographs of the scene to figure
        out how to deal with the materials and had decided to defer any action until
        Saturday at the earliest, Oates said.\n\"It''s not something I''ve ever seen
        before,\" said Oates, who said that the area was evacuated and that police
        were expected to remain on the scene \"for hours or days.\"\nHolmes, a graduate
        student from San Diego who was in the process of withdrawing from the neuroscience
        program at the University of Colorado-Denver medical school, put up no resistance
        when he was arrested in a parking lot at the theater, police said. He retained
        legal counsel and wasn''t answering investigators'' questions, they said.\n\"We
        are confident he acted alone,\" Oates said of Holmes, who was scheduled to
        appear in Arapahoe County District Court on Monday morning to face unspecified
        charges. Authorities refused to speculate on his possible motive.\nOne of
        those killed was Jessica Ghawi, a sportswriter who survived a June 2 mass
        shooting at a mall in Toronto in which two people were killed and seven others
        were injured. Ghawi blogged under the name Jessica Redfield.\nDefense officials
        told NBC News that a sailor at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora was missing
        and presumed to have been killed. A second sailor and two airmen from Buckley
        were also shot. Their identities and conditions weren''t available.\n''Mass
        chaos''\nAuthorities said the gunman appeared at the front of the theater
        at 12:39 a.m. (2:39 a.m. ET), about 20 minutes into the film, and released
        two canisters of gas. Witnesses told reporters that the gunfire erupted during
        a shootout scene. Authorities responded within a minute and a half, Oates
        said.\n\"It was mass chaos,\" witness Jennifer Seeger told TODAY. The gunman
        shot the ceiling and then \"he threw in the gas can, and then I knew it was
        real.\"\nWitnesses said the gunman entered the theater at Aurora Town Center
        through an emergency exit door. But a federal law enforcement official told
        The Associated Press that the suspect bought a ticket and went in as part
        of the crowd. He is believed to have propped open an exit door as the movie
        was playing, the official said.\nWatch live video from KUSA\nAurora is a suburb
        less than 10 miles east of downtown Denver and just 15 miles northeast of
        Littleton, near the scene of what had been the worst mass shooting in Colorado:
        the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, when two gunmen killed
        12 fellow students and a teacher and wounded 26 other people before killing
        themselves.\nThree of the suspect''s four weapons were found in his white
        Hyundai parked at the back entrance to the theater; one of the handguns was
        found in the theater.\nLaw enforcement officials told NBC News that the weapons
        were legally bought from local stores of two national chains \u2014 Gander
        Mountain Guns and Bass Pro Shop \u2014 beginning in May.\nOates didn''t say
        what kind of magazines were used, but he said \"many, many rounds were fired.\"
        Some rounds penetrated an adjoining theater and injured at least one person,
        he said.\nJennifer Seeger, who sat in the second row of the theater when the
        gunman arrived, tells NBC''s Brian Williams about her ordeal.\nJames Yacone,
        the FBI''s agent in charge in Denver, said there was no indication of a link
        to terrorism. Holmes wasn''t on any federal law enforcement watch lists, authorities
        told NBC News, and Oates said he had no police record beyond a speeding ticket
        last year.\nThe few people who had any contact with Holmes described him as
        a recluse who lived with his shades drawn and who, when he did meet someone,
        revealed little.\n\"He kept to himself, didn''t like a lot of attention,\"
        said Melvin Evans, a neighbor.\nAnother neighbor, Kaitlyn Fonzi, said, \"We
        never heard anything abnormal until midnight this morning, when we heard loud
        techno music playing\" from Holmes'' apartment.\n''Pain and grief ... too
        intense for words''\nGov. John Hickenlooper said at a news conference that
        \"our hearts are broken as we think of the friends and family of the victims
        of this senseless tragedy.\" He called the shootings \"the act of an apparently
        very deranged mind.\"\n\"The pain and grief (are) too intense for words, but
        we can''t let it keep us from our lives,\" Hickenlooper said. \"We are going
        to come back stronger from this, but it is obviously going to be a very long
        process.\"\nPresident Barack Obama cut short a campaign visit to Florida to
        return to Washington ahead of schedule.\nHe called for reflection after the
        attack. \"There are going to be other days for politics,\" Obama said during
        an abbreviated appearance in Fort Myers, where he led a moment of silence
        on behalf of the victims and their families.\nMore on this story from breakingnews.com\nAt
        a campaign appearance in Bow, N.H., Republican presidential challenger Mitt
        Romney said: \"Today is to remember and reach out and remember our blessings
        in life. Each of us will hold family close and spend a little less time thinking
        about the worries of our day and helping those in need of compassion.\"\n''We
        need to go''\nMoviegoers described scenes of chaos and terror inside the movie
        theater.\nTanner Coon, 17, describes seeing flashes of gunfire, which he thought
        were fireworks, amid the chaos of trying to escape the shooting as he was
        \"trying to calm\" his friend''s 12-year-old brother.\nTanner Coon, who was
        in the theater with a friend and the friend''s 12-year-old brother when the
        shooter came in, said he told them to \"get down\" when he heard the gunshots.\nThe
        shooter fired off about 20 rounds and there was then a pause and a \"period
        of quietness when everybody started running out,\" Coon said.\n\"I slipped
        on some blood and landed on a lady. I shook her and said, ''We need to go.''
        There was no response, so I presume she was dead,\" Coon said.\nPhotoBlog:
        More images from the scene of the shooting in Aurora\nParis premiere canceled\nFilm
        critics have noted the dark, anxiety-fueled themes of \"The Dark Knight Rises,\"
        which reminded some of the atmosphere in the days after the terrorist attacks
        of Sept. 11, 2001. It had been projected to be one of the biggest films of
        the year, and theaters around the world began showing it at 12:01 a.m. Friday.\n\"Warner
        Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking
        incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones
        of the victims at this tragic time,\" the studio said in a statement.\nChris
        Dodd, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, said in a statement:\n\"We
        share the shock and sadness of everyone in the motion picture community at
        the news of this terrible event. We extend our prayers and deepest sympathies
        to the victims, their loved ones and all those affected by this tragedy.\"\nMiguel
